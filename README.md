Indoor Tracking System based on Inertial Measurement Unit

This is the initial development of the project that I did during my 10 weeks of industrial training.

The system is not perfect yet, but I will make it perfect one day....hopefully...... 

Instructions:

IMU_Arduino_Code.ino is the Arduino code for the hardware.

app1.mlapp is the MATLAB app code for the entire app.

All the folders above are the library file for supporting the system.


Feel free to check it out. HeHe ðŸ‘¨
